Yesterday I posted my 2nd video about syncthing on youtube.
{{< youtube _PXNxpdAvJM >}}

 It tells you how to install syncthing on Linux.  I am planning on a few more videos about syncthing.   Some of the videos include installing syncthing on windows,  installing it and setting it up on android, and setting it up on windows or Linux. I might even make a more advanced syncthing tutorial telling how to set up more advanced syncthing options.   I might even show you how to install the syncthing relay service.
