I just bought a 4 port ethernet card on eBay to add to my Proxmox server.   I am going to use the 4 port ethernet card on my pfsense server to control my entire network.   It will allow me to set up VLANs to separate my different devices.  I am planning on using some just for my IoT devices.  One network will just be for the servers I have run on the Proxmox server.   I will be using two pi-holes for my DNS.  I am planning on getting a rack system and mounting my Proxmox server inside of the rack.   I first have to get a case and power supply for the Proxmox server before I can make it into a route mount.
