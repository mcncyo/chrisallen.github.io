I am going to be buying a new tripod from amazon.  I should be getting it in a couple of days. [KINGJOY 75" Camera [Tripod](https://amzn.to/3DluoiD) has an adaptor to use a camera or a phone on the tripod.  It is only around $33.00 to buy it. I will tell you more about it on this page when I play around with it.  I will be using it to hold my phone right now and later on I can buy a camera to do my videos on.
