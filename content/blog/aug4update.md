The past couple of weeks has been crazy. My contract work got canceled because they didn't realize how much it would cost to have it installed. They have done this before also with other projects. They start it and never finish it.

I am having issues getting my 1u Proxmox server up and running. I didn't realize you had to have a raid interface when I bought it. Some of the power cords are not long enough. Also, they sent me the wrong CPU heatsink.  They are sending me a replacement. It should come today in the mail.
