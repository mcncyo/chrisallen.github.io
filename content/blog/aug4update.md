description: "Navigating project cancellations and server setup issues: the challenges of contract work and Proxmox server installations."
---

The past couple of weeks have been a whirlwind. My contract work got canceled because the client underestimated the installation costs. This isn't the first time they've done this; they have a history of starting projects and never finishing them.

I'm also facing issues with my 1U Proxmox server setup. When I bought it, I didn't realize that a RAID interface was necessary. Additionally, some of the power cords are too short, and to top it off, they sent me the wrong CPU heatsink. Fortunately, a replacement is on the way and should arrive in the mail today.
