Busy Schedule Update: New Projects and Upgrades

I've been incredibly busy with work and personal commitments recently, which has limited my time for YouTube and managing my websites. However, I’ve managed to release a few new videos on my YouTube channel. Moving forward, I’m excited to announce that I’ll be dedicating the next two weeks to focusing on my projects.
Upcoming Projects and Video Content

One of my major projects is creating a comprehensive how-to-use Syncthing video. This video will cover everything you need to know about Syncthing, including setup and practical uses.

Additionally, I’m in the process of converting both of my websites from WordPress to Hugo static sites. This migration aims to enhance performance and improve user experience.
Recent Purchases and Upgrades

I recently purchased several items from eBay to upgrade my tech setup:

    1U Server Case: I’m moving my Proxmox server into a new 1U server case. This upgrade required new heat sinks for my Proxmox CPUs.
    HP ProCurve 24-Port 1GB Switch: This networking switch will expand my network capabilities, allowing me to connect more devices.
    TP-Link Archer C9 Router: I’ve installed DD-WRT firmware on my TP-Link Archer C9 v1. Although I plan to upgrade the router eventually, that will be a few weeks to a couple of months down the line.

I’m also planning to add a few 4GB hard drives to my Proxmox server and create a ZFS pool for better data management.

Stay tuned for more updates and detailed videos on these exciting developments!
