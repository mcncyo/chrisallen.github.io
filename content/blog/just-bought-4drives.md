This is just a quick update.  I bought 4 solid-state drives from Amazon each of them has 500GB.  They will be going into my Proxmox server.   I am going to use ZFS file system where 2 will be stripped and mirrored on them.  So I have a little under 1 GB of total space for Proxmox.  I can always add more drives to the new Proxmox server I am building.  I might make a quick video on me moving my Proxmox server from my old case to the new 1u case.  Before I start I will have to make sure my VM are all back up to my windows10 computer.  I might just throw the current hard drive I use for Proxmox in an enclosure and use it for backup.  I haven't thought through that part yet.
