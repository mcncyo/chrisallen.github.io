I am currently looking for a good-paying job. I have had a few interviews in the last few days. Most of the jobs they want to offer me were not for me or had low pay. While I wait on finding a good job, I am doing some gig work like door dash, uber eats and GrubHub mostly in west Wichita.

I have also been working on this website and <https://computerhacking101.com>> website. I also have been working on some youtube videos for my channel.
