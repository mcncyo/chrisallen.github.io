I posted my 3rd video about syncthing on youtube.
{{< youtube _PXNxpdAvJM >}}

I got two more videos about syncthing that I plan on adding to my youtube channel. It is how to use syncthing and go through a lot of the options. It will show you how to just transfer one way which I use for the backup of my Proxmox server. I will show you many advanced options for syncthing. I will also show you how to install the syncthing relay service in another video.
