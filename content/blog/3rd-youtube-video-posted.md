I've just posted my third video about Syncthing on YouTube. Check it out here:

{{< youtube _PXNxpdAvJM >}}

I also have two more Syncthing videos planned for my channel. These upcoming videos will guide you through various Syncthing options, including how to set up one-way transfers, which I use for backing up my Proxmox server. Additionally, I'll demonstrate several advanced Syncthing features and show you how to install the Syncthing relay service.

Stay tuned for more!
