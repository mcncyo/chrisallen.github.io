I started to move my Proxmox server to my 1u case and ran into a couple of problems.  One is easily fixed and for the other one I will have to wait for a while.   I am going to have to move the stand-offs for the motherboard. I just have to get a different wrench set.  I lost the one I need of course. For the other one, I will have to wait until the heat sync company sends me the correct heat sync.  Then sent one correctly the other one they sent was wrong.  It is coming from china so it will take a few weeks to get that part in.
