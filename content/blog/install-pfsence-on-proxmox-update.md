Description: "Update about pfsence on my server"
---

 I am going to wait to install pfsense on my Proxmox server.   I am going to work on getting  <https://computerhacking101.com> and work on some youtube videos I am created. I might wait and install it on another system.   I  have a couple of computers that I might use of them to install pfsense on.  I haven't decided if I want to install pfsense on bare metal or install Proxmox then pfsense.
