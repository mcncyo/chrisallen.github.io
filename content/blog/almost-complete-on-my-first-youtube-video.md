description: "Almost done with my first youtube video"
---
I am getting very close to completing the first main youtube video called "dropbox vs synching".   I have most of the editing done with it I have to create a part of the power presentation that will go over when I am speaking.  I am also working on creating the script for my next video that shows you how to install syncthing on Linux.  I got the page on the website almost done for that video but still have a lot of work to get the one about dropbox vs syncthing.   Hopefully, I can release the first video this week, but I am working at my job for 38 hours this week.   So I can't edit the video or record the new one, but I can work on the script and website when I am not doing work at my job.
