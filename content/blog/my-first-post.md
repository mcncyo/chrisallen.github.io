Welcome to My new website. This website is where It will just post things about things I'm thinking about currently. It will have things about home assistant, android, Linux, Proxmox, catholic things, or anything else I want to post. I am currently working on this website and another website called [Computer hacking 101]({{< ref "https://computerhacking101.com" >}} "Computer hacking 101")computer hacking 101 which includes a youtube channel. It will have information on how to make your computer and your home network work the way you want them to. I am currently working on making a few tutorials on syncthing for that site.
