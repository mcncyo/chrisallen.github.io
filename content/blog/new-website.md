I just convert this wordpress site to hugo.  There is still a few more things I want to change and add to it.  I also started working on converting <https://computerhacking101.com> to hugo also.

I am planning on getting the video out how to use syncthing this week before I go back to my 8 to 5 job contract work starting on July 5.   I almost got my office clean up and starting to put a few of my things that I want to sell on ebay.  To see the things I am currently selling on ebay click <https://www.ebay.com/usr/computerhacking101>
