Thanksgiving week kind of sucks for me.  We had my birthday party at my mother-in-law's house on Sunday.  I wasn't feeling too well then, but Monday it hit me and I stay in bed almost all day Monday through Thursday.  Also, Weds was my birthday so It was a bad birthday.

In other news, I still haven't found a computer job yet and still looking.  I am also working on a few youtube videos but because I have been sick, I haven't felt like doing that much.  I hope to have at least one out in a couple of weeks.
