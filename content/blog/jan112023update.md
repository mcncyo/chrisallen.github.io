description: "What has been going on the past few weeks"

Wow, the past few weeks have been insane with Christmas and my grandma's hospital visits. But the good news is she's all better now and back at home relaxing. I've been keeping myself busy too though, working on my home network and getting my website, computerhacking101.com, set up on it. I've even got a new subdomain, links.computerhacking101.com, where I can easily update affiliate links and other stuff. And on top of all that, I'm almost done with a script for a couple of videos I'm planning on releasing this month. Phew!
