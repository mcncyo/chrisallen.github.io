I have been having a lot of backup pain lately.  So I haven't been able to do what I wanted to do with the website and create another video about how to use syncthing for computer hacking 101 websites.  I am going back to work starting on Tuesday and working my 8 to 5 job contract work.  So I will not have much time to work on the website or youtube.  I have to do this contract work because I need to bring in more money for my family and have money to buy things I need for my youtube channel. Hopefully, soon I will have the video out within the next week or so but not promise.  I also bought a 1u rack mount case that I need to install my Proxmox server into. (currently, it is in one of the old computer cases that I had since early 2000.)   I am planning on making a video about that soon also, but I want to get my office cleaned up before I do it.

I also plan on selling a few things that I have on eBay. To see the things I am currently selling on eBay click <https://www.ebay.com/usr/computerhacking101>>.  I currently only have one thing up there but I am planning on adding my collection of baseball cards. and USB 2.0 5 port PCI card and USB to ps/2 adaptor to eBay soon.
