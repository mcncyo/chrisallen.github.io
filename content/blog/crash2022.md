I just started to get back on my feet after I got sick before Thanksgiving. Then last Friday I was doing some door dashing and tripped and hurt my lip and skinned my hands and knee.  On  Monday my wife and I were going to a casino near here and there was an accident going northbound on the turnpike that had flying debris that hit my car.   It shatter the window and did some front bumper damage to my car.  below are a few images of the accident.
