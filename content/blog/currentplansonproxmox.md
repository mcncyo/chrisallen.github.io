description: "My current ideas for my Proxmox server"

My current plan setup from my Proxmox server is as follows:
going to have 4 500GB solid-state drives.  I am going to set up a windows share on my windows 10 computer that will host the iso and backups. This will allow me to back up my backups on a local computer without having to use space on my Proxmox server and it will be automatically backed up to my Backblaze account.
